# Study-and-Implemantation-for-Convex-and-Non-Convex-Optimization-Problems

Hi, I'm a studant at UNICAMP (Universidade Estadual de Campinas), and I
am learning about optimization techiniques, so I pretend to implement 
some of the techiniques I will learn here, with academic purpose only. The implementations here 
aren't mine but from lectures and books I find interesting. I will not 
try to do the fastest algorithms but make them easy to understand and learn.
I'm trying to comment them a lot too, I hope this helps someone :).

I'm just starting to implement one simple backtracking algorithm and the
zoom algorithm of the book Numerical Optimization from Jorge Nocedal and
Stephen J. Wright (second edition) on pages 60 and 61. I have to improve
the way the step direction is choose and test the algorithm better because
I was having some numerical issues.
